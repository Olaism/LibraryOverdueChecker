## Problem statement

Write an application that computes the total charges for the overdue library
books. For each library book, the user enters the due date and (optionally) the
overdue charge per day, the maximum charge, and the title. If the optional values
are not entered, then the preset default values are used. A complete list of book
information is displayed when the user finishes entering the input data. The user
can enter different return dates to compare the overdue charges.
